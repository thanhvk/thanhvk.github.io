    "career.resumesp1": "You’ll find templates for printed resumes online—and you’ll find some employers want you to enter resume data into an online database. Either way, there is basic information you need to gather to do either. Here’s what you need:",
    "career.resumesA": "Contact information: ",
    "career.resumesA1": "Name, address, telephone number and e-mail address go at the top of your resume. You may want to list URLs for your profession-related website or social media pages. Make it easy for employers to contact you. If you use a school or temporary address, indicate that and provide the date the address expires. Offer a permanent address where you can be reached after that date.",
    "career.resumesB": "Objective/Summary of Skills:",
    "career.resumesB1": "Some employers look for an objective; others consider it a waste of space. If you want to include an objective, tailor it to the job and/or to the company. If you include a skills summary, it should match the job posting.",
    "career.resumesC": "Education:",
    "career.resumesC1": "The education section should come next for a new graduate and should include the name of your college, your degree, and the date you received (or expect to receive) your diploma. You may also want to include relevant coursework, projects, and academic awards to demonstrate the skills and knowledge you have acquired.",
    "career.resumesC2": "If your GPA is 3.0 or above, you should include it in this area. If you have a poor or mediocre GPA, talk with a career center counselor about how to provide positives on your resume instead.",
    "career.resumesD": "Experience:",
    "career.resumesD": "Employers are going to look closely at this section of your resume and they want to see evidence that you can do the job and have the skills and qualities of a good employee. Include relevant work experience here—earned through an internship or cooperative education program. Highlight your responsibilities and accomplishments.",
    "career.resumesD1": "Unrelated experience—part- or full-time jobs and volunteer positions—that don’t line up with the job you are applying for can help you show how you gained prized skills through them.",
    "career.resumesD2": "Your experience should be listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position and working back. For each position, include the dates of your employment, the employer’s name and location, your job title, and a bulleted list of work tasks with results.",
    "career.resumesD4": "Use verbs such as “developed,” “facilitated,” or “coached” to begin each of the bulleted items.",
    "career.resumesE": "Other categories:",
    "career.resumesE1": "You may want to include other categories such as skills, honors, awards, and extracurricular activities—especially if it helps you provide the employer with evidence that you can do the job and do it well.",
    "career.resumesE2": "Some employers want to see hobbies or interests in order to get a better feel for you as a person. Some do not care.",
    "career.resumesE3": "Talk to a career center counselor for advice—and to get your resume critiqued before you pass it along to a potential employer.",
    "career.interviewsh2": "Interviews",
    "career.interviewsp1": "Your resume gets you an interview—but a resume just tells part of your story. The interview is your chance to showcase what you’ve put on paper—skills, abilities, and knowledge that will help you get the job.",
    "career.interviewsp2": "Prep First ",
    "career.interviewsp21": "Doing your research is an essential step that not every job candidate takes—and employers can tell who does and who doesn’t. In a competitive job market, a lack of research looks like a lack of interest.",
    "career.interviewsp22": "Read the job description carefully. Review the organization’s website and social media pages. Check the career center for company literature, and call on your college alumni who work for the organization or in the industry for insight and advice. Turn to faculty for advice. Go to information sessions in advance of interviews. Attend career fairs and talk with company representatives.",
    "career.interviewsp23": "Take time to think about your qualifications, skills, and attributes and how they might fit into the position advertised and the company that’s hiring.",
    "career.interviewsp24": "Research pays off by helping you provide clear connections between what you have to offer and what the organization needs. In addition, your interest in the company—as demonstrated by your knowledge gained in the research—will impress on the interviewer that you’re a serious candidate. And, a little research will help you ask intelligent questions that will impress the interviewer and help you decide if the organization is a good fit for you.",
    "career.interviewsp3": "Practice Next",
    "career.interviewsp31": "Take advantage of practice/mock interviews and interview workshops offered by your career center. Practice interviews will help you think through the answers to potential questions, polish your verbal communication skills, and gain confidence that will show in the interview. They’ll give you a chance to get feedback and advice from professionals.",
    "career.interviewsp32": "Practice interviews aren’t about memorizing answers. They’re a chance to think through your answers to questions and help you illustrate your answers with specific examples. Ever walked away from a situation and thought—“Oh, I should have said…?” Practice interviews will help you say exactly what you want to say.",
    "career.interviewsp4": "Arrive Early ",
    "career.interviewsp41": "Arrive 15 minutes in advance so that you can compose yourself before the interview. Drive the route between your home and the company a day or two before your interview to ensure you know the way and how long it will take you to get there.",
    "career.interviewsp42": "Then, consider yourself “on” in the parking lot, the front door, the hallway, the waiting room—everything about your appearance (including being on time) is going to contribute to the impression of you as a job candidate.",
    "career.interviewsp43": "Your job for the next 30 to 60 minutes—or longer if you’re doing multiple interviews—is to show the interviewer that you have the qualifications and skills for the job and organization. Be confident.",
    "career.interviewsp5": "Ask Questions",
    "career.interviewsp51": "At some point during the interview, you’re going to be asked, “Do you have any questions?” The answer is never “no.” Failure to ask thoughtful questions may be seen as a negative, and asking intelligent questions can enhance your candidacy.",
    "career.interviewsp52": "First, you demonstrate your knowledge of the organization and your interest by asking thoughtful questions—questions that show you’ve researched the organization.",
    "career.interviewsp53": "TPlus, your questions can help you decide if this is the right job and organization for you.",
    "career.interviewsp54": "Close the interview by restating your interest in the company and ask for the job!",
    "career.interviewsp6": "Evaluate, Critique, Follow Up",
    "career.interviewsp61": "When the interview is over, you’re still not quite finished.",
    "career.interviewsp62": "Follow up with the interviewer by sending a thank-you note. Be prompt with your note—send it via e-mail within 24 hours, if possible and reiterate your interest in the job.",
    "career.interviewsp63": "Critique your interview performance. What went well? What needs improvement?",
    "career.interviewsp64": "Evaluate the job and the organization. Is this the right fit for you? ",
    "career.interviewsp65": "Your success at interviewing comes down to preparation and practice. Good luck!",
    "career.interviewsp7": "VIDEO INTERVIEW",
    "career.interviewsp71": "As more employers embrace video and Web-based technologies to conduct screening interviews with prospective job candidates, it becomes increasingly important for you to be prepared as you begin your job-search. Here are some tips for successful interviewing via video/web.",
    "career.interviewsp72": "Before Your Video/Web Interview",
    "career.interviewsp721.title": "Determine the Best Hardware to Use. ",
    "career.interviewsp721": "If you’re lucky enough to have multiple devices (such as a computer, tablet, smart phone), choose the one you are most comfortable with — and the one with the most reliable technology. If necessary, invest in purchasing — or borrowing — the best technology to use for the interview.",
    "career.interviewsp722.title": "Select the Proper Location for the Interview. ",
    "career.interviewsp722": "The ideal scenario for your interview location is a secluded room in which you can shut out distractions (and noises), control the lighting, and display a generic background. Ideally, you’ll want to have some diffused lighting so as not to create shadows or glare… and a plain wall as your backdrop. You should also have a location in which you can be seen on camera from about the waist up — not just your face.",
    "career.interviewsp723.title": "Test All the Technology. ",
    "career.interviewsp723": "Test your connection. Test your camera. Test your lighting. Test your sound. Test the video program. Make sure you understand how it all works.",
    "career.interviewsp724.title": "Schedule at Least One Mock Interview. ",
    "career.interviewsp724": "Under as close to identical circumstances as possible, schedule an interview with a friend, colleague, or family member. Practice both your interviewing skills, as well as the technology. If you can, record the interview so you can play it back for yourself. If can’t record it, ask for as much feedback as possible — especially for how you look and sound. (Learn more about the benefits of mock interviews.)",
    "career.interviewsp725.title": "Plan for Glitches. ",
    "career.interviewsp725": "Have a backup plan if something goes wrong the day of the interview.  ",
    "career.interviewsp726.title": "Complete Full Interview Preparations. ",
    "career.interviewsp726": "Don’t skimp on your interview prep. Conduct research on the employer, prepare responses to expected interview questions, formulate a few questions you want to ask, and determine the best professional outfit for the interview. (Learn more in this job interview checklist.)  ",
    "career.interviewsp8": "Day of the Web/Video Interview",
    "career.interviewsp81.title": "Test All Equipment Prior to Interview Time. ",
    "career.interviewsp81": "Do a run-through at least an hour before your interview time",
    "career.interviewsp82.title": "Dress Professionally. ",
    "career.interviewsp82": "Remember, nothing too flashy. If unsure, view yourself in the monitor.",
    "career.interviewsp83.title": "Turn Off Before Interview Starts. ",
    "career.interviewsp83": "Remember to turn off all apps and programs that might interrupt the interview.",
    "career.interviewsp84.title": "Go Under. ",
    "career.interviewsp84": "Go to your interview location and shut out all distractions. ",
    "career.interviewsp85.title": "Remember Your Nonverbals. ",
    "career.interviewsp85": "Make solid eye contact and smile at appropriate times. Have good posture and even lean in a bit. Use hand gestures to make your point.",
    "career.interviewsp86.title": "Look Directly into the Camera. ",
    "career.interviewsp86": "You might be tempted to look at the monitor or yourself, but focus on making eye contact via the camera.",
    "career.interviewsp87.title": "Have a Conversation. ",
    "career.interviewsp87": "Speak in a conversational voice, just as you would in an actual interview situation.",
    "career.interviewsp88.title": "Notes if You Need Them. ",
    "career.interviewsp88": "Unlike other interview situations, you can have some notes in front of you (off camera) to remind you of critical issues you want to highlight, but do NOT overuse them, or you will look odd on camera.",
    "career.interviewsp89.title": "Take a Second. ",
    "career.interviewsp89": "When responding to questions from the interviewer, nod, but take a second before responding in case the connection is weak — so that you don’t end up talking over the interviewer.",

    "career.salariesp21": "Be truthful when discussing your salary history.",
    "career.salariesp22": "Reflect upon, but do NOT disclose your minimum salary figure.",
    "career.salariesp23": "When a range is named, affirm the top number. For example, if the employer states the range for the position is $37,000 to $47,000 per year, you might respond by stating, “$47,000 sounds fair when compared with the other opportunities I am considering”.",
    "career.salariesp24": "Consider the total compensation package. What is the value of your vacation time, healthcare benefits, flex time, etc?",
    "career.salariesp25": "Never accept an offer immediately. Tell the employer that you appreciate the opportunity, but need to take some time to consider the offer.",
    "career.salariesp26": "Be professional when turning down an offer. The people you met at organization A could be your colleagues at organization B in a year or two.",
    "career.salariesp27": "Know your value: If the salary offered is lower than you are willing to accept, make a list of what you would bring to the employer, including background, skills, experience, and education that match the job description. When speaking to a hiring representative, show your initiative and desire to make a contribution.",
    "career.salariesp3": "Salary Discussion during the Interview ",
    "career.salariesp31": "Timing is Everything",
    "career.salariesp32": "Avoid discussing salary until you are offered the position. Delaying the discussion of salary will give you time to do research and determine your market value relative to the specific position and give you the opportunity to convince the prospective employer that you are the one for the job.",
    "career.salariesp33": "Do Your Research",
    "career.salariesp34": "Armed with information about the industry, the organization, its competitors, the function and the specific position as well as the cost of living where the job is based, you will have the leverage you need to negotiate the best offer possible.",
    "career.salariesp35": "Last Resort",
    "career.salariesp36": "Many employers will persist in requesting salary information, or may state that only candidates who provide this information will proceed in the interview process. First, try to respectfully change the subject. Some examples of how to direct the conversation away from specific numbers include:",
    "career.salariesp37": "“I would be happy to talk about that at the appropriate time.  Why don’t you tell me more about …? ”",
    "career.salariesp38": "“Before we get to that, let me make sure I am even in your ballpark.  What is the salary range for this position?”",
    "career.salariesp39": "“I am not comfortable discussing salary at this stage.  Perhaps we can do so when we meet in person (or after learning more about the responsibilities)?”",
    "career.salariesp310": "“For a person with the skills and experience you want, I would expect that this position would not pay less than ‘x.’  Correct?”",
    "career.salariesp311": "“I do not wish to discuss salary until I develop a better understanding of the challenges of the position.”",
